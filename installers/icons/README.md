### macOS

The icons with multiple levels of detail are in the `*.iconset`
directories.


### Windows

Are generated automatically, based on the PNG files.

Currently, the Windows installer uses the bundle with 8 of the icons.


### Linux

The desktop launcher uses one of `{mainnet,staging,testnet}/1024x1024.png` (see `iconPath` in `../../default.nix`)
